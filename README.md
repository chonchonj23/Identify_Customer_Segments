# Identify_Customer_Segments
This is an unsupervised learning project in Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree. Students are required to apply practical skills such as data wrangling, Principal Component Analysis, and unsupervised learning techniques in this project.

This project provides students with plenty of opportunities to practise Matplotlib and Seaborn, which can quickly produce beautiful data visualizations.

Real-life data (like those used in this project) are typically messy and have lots of features; [Principal Component Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) turns out to be a very effective technique for dimensionality reduction. 

K-means Clustering is one of the unsupervised learning techniques that can divide data into meaningful groups/segments; this technique is particularly useful for developing effective marketing strategies. 


## This project was completed with Python 3.x and the following libraries:

* [NumPy](https://numpy.org)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.15/tutorials.html)
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)
* [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org)


## Licenses:

No data is available here; students need to REMOVE all data files from their computer via the agreement with Arvato Bartlesmann after completing the project, as the data are proprietary.
